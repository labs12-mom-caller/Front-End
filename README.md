# Front-End

Recaller is an app that allows users to schedule calls between themselves and their loved ones. The app programmatically calls both the user and their loved one and records their call. It uses the Deepgram API to make a transcription of the call and then sends it to both parties by email. Previous recordings and transcripts are accessible online.

## Mission statement:

We believe in connecting families and friends. In order to facilitate this, we will build an app that allows you to schedule phone calls and have a transcript of your conversations to remember details from your calls. By offering calls, automation, and flexible configuration we work to ensure families stay in touch.
